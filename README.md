# foo_resizer

foo_resizer is a small plugin for foobar2000 which allows you to:
- lock foobar's main window size
- disable maximize button
- disable minimize button
- disable close button
- disable title bar
- smart autostart after windows restart / shutdown (if the foobar was playing, it starts playing at the same track's position).

Tested on windows 10 x64. Compiled with vs2015.

Feel free to ask for new features!

Enjoy foobar2000!
